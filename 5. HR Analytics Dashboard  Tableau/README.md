# HR Analytics Dashboard (IBM) - Tableau

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help organizations improve employee performance and retention by creating an HR Analytics dashboard. The dashboard aims to uncover factors leading to employee attrition and explore important questions such as the breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition, and the comparison of average monthly income by education and attrition.

## About the Dataset
This dataset is a fictional one created by IBM data scientists. It includes various columns representing employee characteristics, such as education level, job involvement, job satisfaction, performance rating, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance. The dataset helps analyze the factors affecting employee attrition.

## Dashboard Analysis Findings
The dashboard provides key insights into employee attrition and other HR metrics:

- Employee Count: 1,470
- Attrition Count: 237 (16.12% attrition rate)
- Active Employees: 1,233
- Average Age: 37 Years

### Attrition by Gender:
- Female: 87 employees
- Male: 150 employees

### Attrition by Department:
- Sales: 92 employees (39%)
- R&D: 133 employees (56%)
- HR: 12 employees (5%)

### Number of Employees by Age Group (Bins Size 3):

- Highest employee count in the age group 34-39 with 213 employees

### Job Role and Job Satisfaction:
- The highest job satisfaction rating (4) is observed for Sales Representatives, followed by Managers and Research Scientists.

### Education Field Wise Attrition:
- Employees with Life Sciences and Medical background have the highest attrition rate 89 and 63 respectively out of 237, followed by Human Resources and Marketing.

### Attrition by Gender and Age Group:
- Both Male and Female employees in the age group under-25 have the highest attrition rate of 8.4% and 7.6%, respectively.

## Conclusion
The HR Analytics dashboard provides valuable insights into employee attrition patterns, job satisfaction, and demographics. The analysis highlights potential areas of concern, such as higher attrition rates in certain departments and age groups, as well as satisfaction levels among different job roles. Organizations can use these findings to make data-driven decisions and implement strategies to improve employee retention and overall performance.
