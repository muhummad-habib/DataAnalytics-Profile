# Airline Data Analytics Case-study | SQLite + Python

This project aims to address the challenges faced by a leading air transportation company through data analytics. The company is experiencing issues like stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased labor costs, and rising fuel prices, which impact profitability and growth prospects. To ensure long-term sustainability and success, the company plans to analyze its database to increase aircraft occupancy rates and maximize average profit per seat.

## Problem Statement

The airline company aims to enhance aircraft occupancy rates and identify strategic opportunities to increase profitability per seat. The key challenges are as follows:

1. Stricter environmental regulations: These regulations raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: Increased taxes raise the overall cost of flying, reducing demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: Scarcity of skilled workers leads to higher labor costs and increased turnover rates.

## Technologies Used

- SQLite: The database used for storing and managing airline data.
- Python: The programming language used for data analysis and visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite database

## Libraries Used

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Numerical computing in Python.
- matplotlib: Data visualization.
- seaborn: Data visualization based on matplotlib.
- json: Working with JSON data.

## Data Source

The data is stored in an SQLite database and includes several tables related to flights, aircrafts, tickets, bookings, boarding passes, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project includes various exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks to gain insights into the data and understand trends and patterns. Some of the EDA tasks are as follows:

- Analysis of aircraft data: The project visualizes aircraft models and their ranges.
- Analysis of airport data: This section provides insights into airport information like airport codes, names, cities, coordinates, and time zones.
- Analysis of booked seats: This section analyzes the number of booked seats for each flight.

## Data Visualization

The project utilizes various data visualization techniques to present the findings from the exploratory data analysis. Some of the visualizations include:

- Aircraft models with their ranges: A bar chart is used to show the range of different aircraft models.
- Aircraft with more than 100 seats: A bar chart displays the number of planes with more than 100 seats.
- Temporal trends in tickets booked and total revenue: Line plots show the number of tickets booked and total revenue over time.
- Average costs associated with different fare conditions for each aircraft: A bar chart compares the average costs for different fare conditions for each aircraft.
- Total revenue and average revenue for each aircraft: A table shows the total revenue and average revenue for each aircraft.
- Average occupancy rate for each aircraft: A table and bar chart illustrate the average occupancy rate for each aircraft.

## Key Insights

The case-study involved analyzing an SQLite database containing various tables related to flights, bookings, aircrafts, airports, and more. The following key insights were derived from the analysis:

1. The dataset includes information on various aircraft models and their respective ranges. The Boeing 777-300 model has the highest range of 11100, followed by Boeing 767-300 with a range of 7900.

2. The number of planes with more than 100 seats is determined. The Boeing 777-300 has the highest number of seats (402), followed by Boeing 767-300 with 222 seats.

3. The temporal trends in the number of tickets booked and the total amount earned are visualized. The number of tickets booked and the total revenue earned has increased over time, indicating positive growth.

4. The average costs associated with different fare conditions for each aircraft are calculated. The Airbus A319-100 has the highest average price for Business class, while the Bombardier CRJ-200 has the lowest average price for Economy class.

5. The total revenue and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft are computed. The Boeing 777-300 generated the highest total revenue, while the Cessna 208 Caravan generated the lowest.

6. The average occupancy rate for each aircraft is determined. The Boeing 777-300 has the highest occupancy rate, indicating efficient utilization of seats, while the Bombardier CRJ-200 has the lowest occupancy rate.

## Recommendations

Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations are provided to the airline company:

1. Focus on increasing occupancy rates: Implement strategies to improve seat occupancy and maximize revenue per flight.
2. Optimize fare conditions: Analyze fare conditions and pricing strategies to attract more customers without compromising revenue.
3. Invest in fuel-efficient aircraft: Upgrade the fleet with fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce operational costs and carbon footprint.
4. Improve workforce management: Implement measures to address the labor market challenges and reduce labor costs.

By leveraging data insights and implementing the recommended strategies, the airline company can enhance its profitability and ensure long-term sustainability in the competitive aviation industry.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, airlines can maximize profitability by analyzing revenue data and making informed decisions. Factors such as total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft play a crucial role in this analysis. By identifying areas for improvement, adjusting pricing strategies, and optimizing routes, airlines can increase their profitability. However, it's important for airlines to consider consumer happiness and safety while striving for profit. Balancing these factors is key to long-term success in the competitive airline industry. Adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization can lead to sustainable growth and success.
