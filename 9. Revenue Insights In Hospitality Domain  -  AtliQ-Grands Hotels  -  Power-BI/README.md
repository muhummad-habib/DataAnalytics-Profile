## Introduction
This project, "Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain | AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis - Power-BI," aims to provide data-driven insights to AtliQ Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain in India, to regain their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. The project uses Power BI for data analysis and visualization.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is facing challenges in losing its market share and revenue due to competition and ineffective decision-making. To overcome this, the management aims to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence." As a data analyst, my role is to provide insights from historical data to support their revenue management team.

## Task List
- Create relevant metrics according to the provided list.
- Design and develop a comprehensive dashboard based on stakeholders' mock-up.

## Learnings
