# HR Analytics Project (IBM Employees Attrition Analysis) - Power-BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an HR Analytics dashboard created using Power BI. The main objective is to help organizations improve employee performance and retention by analyzing factors leading to employee attrition. The dashboard explores key questions such as the breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition, and the comparison of average monthly income by education and attrition.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a fictional one created by IBM data scientists. It contains various columns representing employee characteristics, including education level, job involvement, job satisfaction, performance rating, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance. The dataset helps analyze the factors affecting employee attrition.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

1. **Attrition Rate:** The overall attrition rate in the organization is 16%, indicating a significant turnover of employees.

2. **Education and Attrition:** Employees with higher education levels, such as Bachelor and Masters, have relatively lower attrition rates compared to those with Below College or Doctor degrees.

3. **Age Group and Attrition:** Employees in the age group of 26-35 have the highest attrition rate, followed by employees in the age group of 36-45. Younger employees (18-25) and older employees (55+) have relatively lower attrition rates.

4. **Job Roles and Attrition:** The job roles of Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive have the highest attrition, while Research Scientist and Sales Representative roles also experience significant attrition.

5. **Gender and Attrition:** Male employees show a slightly higher attrition rate compared to female employees.

6. **Employee Tenure:** The average employee tenure in the organization is approximately 4 years, indicating a relatively stable workforce.

7. **Education Field and Attrition:** Employees in the Life Sciences and Medical fields have higher attrition rates compared to other fields like Marketing and Technical Degree.

8. **Job Satisfaction:** The dashboard provides an overview of job satisfaction ratings across different job roles, which can help identify roles with lower satisfaction levels. The highest job satisfaction rating (4) is observed for Sales Representatives, followed by Managers and Research Scientists.

9. **Average Salary:** Average salary breakdown by education level and Job Role helps understand the correlation between salary and attrition. By Job Role, Managers and Research Directors have highest salary and by Education-Level, Doctor-Level educationist have slightly high salary range from other education-level


These insights can help the HR department and organizational leaders to focus on improving employee retention, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, ultimately contributing to better overall employee performance and organizational success.

## Conclusion
The HR Analytics dashboard provides valuable insights into employee attrition and related factors. It helps HR professionals and organizations make informed decisions to improve employee performance, retention, and overall employee satisfaction.
