# DataAnalytics-Profile


Welcome to my Data Analytics Profile repository! This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects and work related to data analysis. Here, I showcase my skills and experience in utilizing various data analysis techniques, tools, and methodologies to derive meaningful insights from data.


## Repository Structure

In this repository I upload my projects related to data analytics and each project directory may contain;

- **/documentaion**: That contains the information about the project.
- **/data**: That contains the datasets used in the project.
- **/notebooks**: That contains Jupyter notebooks with the analysis code and findings for each project.
- **/visualizations**: That contains visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and their respective directories. Each project directory contains detailed documentation, analysis code, and visualizations. You can also find the datasets used in the `/data` directory.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my Data Analysis Portfolio repository!
