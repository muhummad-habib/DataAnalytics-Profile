# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

## Project Overview

The Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, Case Study-1, focuses on analyzing the data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The project aims to understand ridership patterns and behavior to optimize marketing strategies and increase ridership. By utilizing data analysis techniques and tools, the project seeks to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions and improve the overall performance of Cyclistic.

### About Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a bike-share company that launched in 2016 and has since expanded to operate a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. Their bikes are geotracked and can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. Cyclistic offers pricing plans including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders refer to customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members are those who opt for annual memberships. Financial analysis has shown that annual members are more profitable for Cyclistic. To drive future growth, the company aims to convert casual riders into annual members by leveraging their existing awareness of the Cyclistic program and their choice of Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

### Objective Of Project
The objective of the project is to convert casual riders of Cyclistic into annual members. The company aims to increase the number of annual members as they tend to contribute more to the overall revenue and offer greater stability to the business.

### About the Dataset:
The dataset used for analysis was obtained through a data license agreement with DIVVY and the City of Chicago.
It covers a period of 12 months, from January 2022 to December 2022.
The dataset contains approximately 5.6 million data points, providing a rich and extensive source of information.
The data was collected directly by Cyclistic, ensuring its integrity and reliability.
The dataset offers a comprehensive view of rider behavior and trends, enabling meaningful analysis and insights.


### Tools Selection:
For this capstone project, a range of tools were employed to facilitate various tasks. Microsoft Excel was utilized for data organization and basic analysis, allowing for quick exploration and manipulation of the dataset. Python, a versatile programming language, was chosen for its robust data processing and analysis capabilities. Python's extensive libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, provided efficient methods for handling and manipulating large volumes of data.

Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was used to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and charts. This aided in presenting the findings and insights derived from the data analysis in a clear and engaging manner. PowerPoint was employed to create the final project report, incorporating the visualizations and key highlights.

Moreover, GitHub was utilized as a version control system, allowing for seamless collaboration and tracking of project changes. It provided a centralized repository for storing code, documentation, and other project files, ensuring a structured and organized workflow.

While the Google Data Analytics course predominantly focuses on R, the decision to use Python instead was based on prior experience and personal convenience. Having previously worked with Python, it was a familiar and comfortable choice, enabling faster development and execution of the necessary data processing tasks.

Overall, the combination of MS Excel, Python, Tableau, PowerPoint, and GitHub provided a comprehensive toolkit for conducting data analysis, visualization, and reporting in this capstone project.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data:** This directory contains the raw data used for the analysis. [Describe the structure and format of the data files.]

- **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Each notebook is named according to its purpose and includes detailed explanations of the code and steps taken.


- **Visualizations:** This directory contains the visualizations generated during the analysis. 

- **Report:** This directory contains the report that is prepared after the analysis.

- **Documentation:** This directory includes additional documentation, such as project requirements, data dictionaries, and any other relevant information.

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version > 3.5)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas  (Library to deal with dataframes)
- Matplotlib   (Library for visualization)
- Tableau (for interactive visualizations/dashboards)

## Procedure

To get started with the project, I follow these steps:

1. Get the dataset: Download last 12 months data from the link: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

2. MS Excel: I loaded the data of each month one by one in Excel and did some work on it.
 
   Actual Data look like this:
   ![Screenshot (2411)](https://github.com/renzhezhilu/webp2jpg-online/assets/121312917/30eb9535-79a0-45ad-a30a-2b350d8c8ff8)
   ##### Transformation Process Steps In Excel:
- The original dataset consisted of columns such as "ride_id," "rideable_type," "started_at," "ended_at," "start_station_name," "start_station_id," "end_station_name," "end_station_id," "start_lat," "start_lng," "end_lat," "end_lng," and "member_casual."
- The first step in the transformation process was to extract relevant information from the "started_at" and "ended_at" columns.
Using MS Excel, the "started_at" and "ended_at" columns were split into separate columns for date and time.
- Additional columns were created to extract specific details such as the day of the week, month, and duration of the ride.
- The "member_casual" column was retained to indicate whether the rider was a member or a casual rider.
- The transformed dataset included columns such as "ride_id," "rideable_type," "started_at," "start_date," "start_time," "ended_at," "end_date," "end_time," "day," "month," "member_casual," and "duration."
- The duration column was calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.

   After some processing on Data, it look like this:
   ![Screenshot (2410)](https://github.com/renzhezhilu/webp2jpg-online/assets/121312917/70b24ba1-fe8a-4a74-82ef-7b05f9638a38)

   This transformation process allowed for a more structured and organized dataset, enabling further analysis and insights into rider behavior and patterns.

3. Jupyter Notebook (Python): Although I did some data preprocessing and initial analysis in Excel but it's very time taking process if I used Excel for data processing and analysis so that's why I moved to the python notebook to get good results from data.
    ##### The main steps for transforming the data from the loaded DataFrame 'df' to the final data can be summarized as follows:

  - Libraries & Data Loading:
   
    Import the required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, datetime.
Load the individual datasets into separate DataFrames using the pd.read_csv() function.
Store each dataset in variables (e.g., df1, df2, df3, ..., df12).
